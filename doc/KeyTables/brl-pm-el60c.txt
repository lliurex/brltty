Notes
* The long key on the front is the Easy Access Bar.
  It can only be moved one step in each direction (left, right, up, down).
  To emulate the second step, also press any of the lower routing keys
  (those in the row just behind the text cells).
* RoutingKey1 refers to the row of keys just behind the text cells.
* RoutingKey2 refers to the row of keys behind the RoutingKey1 row.
* The rockers at each side of the top that don't stay when pressed
  are named the Left and Right Key.
