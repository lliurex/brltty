<P>Here is explained what <EM>BrlAPI</EM> is, and what it precisely does.
These explanations should be simple enough to be accessible to every user.
For a more technical review of <EM>BrlAPI</EM>'s functionalities, please see chapter
<A HREF="BrlAPI-5.html#sec-library">Libary description</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc2.1">Historical notes.</A>
</H2>

<P>Originally, <EM>brltty</EM> was designed to give access to the Linux
console to visually impaired people, through a braille terminal
or a speech synthetizer. At that time, applications running in the
console were not taking care of the presence of a braille
terminal (most applications didn't even know what a braille
terminal was).</P>
<P>This situation where applications are not aware of the presence of a
special device is elegant of course, since it lets use an
unlimited number of applications which don't need to be specially
designed for visually impaired people.</P>
<P>However, it appeared that applications specially designed to take
advantage of a braille terminal could be wanted, to
provide the suitable information to blind users, for instance.
The idea of <EM>BrlAPI</EM> is to propose an efficient communication
mechanism, to control the braille display, read keys from the
braille keyboard, or to exchange data with the braille terminal at
a lower level (e.g. to write file transfer protocols between
braille terminals and Linux systems).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc2.2">Why <EM>BrlAPI</EM> is part of <EM>brltty</EM>.</A>
</H2>

<P>Instead of rewriting a whole communication program from
scratch, we chose to add communication
mechanisms to <EM>brltty</EM>. This choice has two main justifications.</P>
<P>On the one hand, integration to <EM>brltty</EM> allows us to use the
increasing number of drivers written for <EM>brltty</EM>, thus handling
a large number of braille terminals without having to rewrite any
piece of existing code.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if an application chooses to send its own
information to the braille display, and to process braille keys,
<EM>brltty</EM> has to be warned, so that it won't try to communicate
with the braille terminal while the application already does.
To make this synchronzation between <EM>brltty</EM>
and client applications possible, it seemed easier to add the
communication mechanisms to <EM>brltty</EM>'s core, instead of writing an
external program providing them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc2.3">How it works.</A>
</H2>

<P>We are now going to describe the steps an application should
go through to get control of the braille terminal, and what
happens on <EM>brltty</EM>'s side at each step. This step-by-step
description will let us introduce more precisely some
concepts that are useful for every <EM>BrlAPI</EM> user.</P>

<H3>Connection.</H3>

<P>The first thing any client application has to do is to
connect (in the Unix sense of the word) to <EM>BrlAPI</EM> which is
an mere application server. If this is not
clear, the only thing to be remembered is that this
step allows the client application to let the server know about its
presence. At this stage, nothing special is done on <EM>brltty</EM>'s
side.</P>

<H3>Authorization.</H3>

<P>Since Unix is designed to allow many users to work on the
same machine, it's quite possible that there are more than one
user accounts on the system. Most probably, one doesn't want
any user with an account on the machine to be able to communicate
with the braille terminal (just imagine what would happen if,
while somebody was working with the braille terminal, another user
connected to the system began to communicate with it,
preventing the first one from doing his job...). That's why <EM>BrlAPI</EM> has to
provide a way to determine whether a user who established a
connection is really allowed to communicate with the braille
terminal. To achieve this, <EM>BrlAPI</EM> requires that each
application that wants to control a braille terminal sends an
authorization key before doing anything else. The control of
the braille terminal will only be possible for the client once
it has sent the proper authorization key. What is called
authorization key is in fact a Unix file containing data (it
must be non-empty) on your system. All the things you have to do is to give
read permissions on this file to users that are allowed to
communicate with the braille terminal, and only to them. This
way, only authorized users will have access to the
authorization key and then be able to send it to <EM>BrlAPI</EM>.
To see how to do that, please see chapter 
<A HREF="BrlAPI-4.html#sec-install">Installation and configuration</A>.</P>
<P>At the end of this step, the user is authorized to take
control of the braille terminal. On <EM>brltty</EM>'s side, some data
structures are allocated to store information on the client,
but this has no user-level side-effect.</P>

<H3>Real use of the braille terminal.</H3>

<P>Once the client is properly connected and authorized,
there are two possible types of communication with the braille
terminal. The chosen type of communication depends on what the
client plans to do. If its purpose is to display information on
the braille display or to process braille keys, it will have to
take control of the Linux tty on which it is running. If its
purpose is to exchange data with the braille terminal (e.g. for
file transfer), it will enter what is called "raw mode".</P>

<H3>Braille display and braille key presses processing.</H3>

<P>If the client wants to display something on the braille
display or to process braille keys itself, rather than letting
<EM>brltty</EM> process them, it has to take control of the Linux
terminal it is running on.</P>
<P>Once a client has obtained the control of his tty, <EM>BrlAPI</EM>
will completely discard <EM>brltty</EM>'s display on this tty (and only
this one), leaving the braille display free for the client.</P>
<P>At the same time, if a key is pressed on the braille
keyboard, <EM>BrlAPI</EM> checks whether the client application is
interested in this key or not. If it is, the key is passed to
it, either as a key code or as a <EM>brltty</EM> command. If it is not, the
key code is converted into a <EM>brltty</EM> command and returned to
<EM>brltty</EM>.</P>
<P>Once the client is not interested in displaying text
or reading braille keys any more, it has to leave the tty, so
that either <EM>brltty</EM> can continue its job, or another client can
take control of it.</P>

<H3>Raw mode.</H3>

<P>Only one client can be in raw mode at the same time. In
this mode, data coming from the braille terminal are checked
by the driver (to ensure they are valid), but instead of being processed,
they are delivered "as-is" to the client that is in raw mode.</P>
<P>In the other direction, packets sent to <EM>BrlAPI</EM> by the
client that is in raw mode are passed to the driver which is
expected to deliver them to the braille terminal without any
modification.</P>

<H3>Suspend Mode.</H3>

<P>Only one client can be in suspend mode at the same time. This mode is also
exclusive with raw mode. In this mode, the server keeps the device driver
closed, and thus the client can open the device directly by itself.</P>

<P><B>This mode is not recommended</B>, since the client will then have to
reimplement device access. Raw mode should really be preferred, since it lets
the client take advantage of server's ability to talk with the device
(USB/bluetooth support for instance).</P>

<H3>Remarks.</H3>


<P>
<UL>
<LI>The operations described in the three previous
subsections are not completely mutually exclusive. An
application that controls its current tty can enter raw or suspend
mode, provided that no other application already is in this
mode.
</LI>
<LI>Not every braille driver supports raw mode. It has
to be specially (re)written to support it, since it has
to provide special functions to process incoming and outgoing
packets. The same restriction is true (but less strong)
concerning the ability to deliver/convert keycodes into
commands: not every driver has this ability, it has to be
modified to get it.
</LI>
<LI>Operations previously described can be repeated.
You can, for instance, use raw mode to transfer data onto
your braille terminal, display text in braille, return to raw
mode..., all that without having to reconnect to <EM>BrlAPI</EM> before
each operation.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Disconnection.</H3>

<P>Once the client has finished using the braille terminal, it
has to disconnect from the API, so that the memory structures
allocated for the connection can be freed and eventually used by
another client. This step is transparent for the user, in the
sense that it involves no change on the braille display.</P>
