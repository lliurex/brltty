<P><EM>BrlAPI</EM> is a service provided by the <EM>brltty</EM> daemon.</P>
<P>Its purpose is to allow programmers to write applications that take advantage
of a braille terminal in order to deliver a blind user suitable information
for his/her specific needs.</P>
<P>While an application communicates with the braille terminal, everything
<EM>brltty</EM> sends to the braille terminal in the application's console is
ignored, whereas each piece of data coming from the braille terminal is sent to
the application, rather than to <EM>brltty</EM>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc1.1">Concepts</A>
</H2>

<P> All throughout this manual, a few terms will be used which are either
specific to braille terminals, or introduced because of <EM>BrlAPI</EM>. They are defined
below. Taking a few minutes to go through this glossary will save a lot
of time and questions later.</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>Authorization key</B><DD>
<P>A file containing arbitrary data, that has to be sent to the server by the
client, to prove it is allowed to establish a connection and then control
the braille terminal.</P>

<DT><B>Braille display</B><DD>
<P>The small screen on the braille terminal that is able to display braille text.</P>

<DT><B>Braille keyboard</B><DD>
<P>The keyboard of the braille terminal.</P>

<DT><B>Braille terminal</B><DD>
<P>A computer designed to display text in braille. In this case, the text is
supposed to come from another computer running Linux or any other Unix system.</P>

<DT><B>Brltty</B><DD>
<P>The background process that gives a blind person access to the console screen
thanks to a braille terminal or speech synthetizer.</P>

<DT><B>Client</B><DD>
<P>An application designed to handle a braille terminal thanks to <EM>BrlAPI</EM>.</P>

<DT><B>Command</B><DD>
<P>A code returned by the driver, indicating an action to do, for instance
"go to previous line", "go to next line", etc.</P>

<DT><B>Driver</B><DD>
<P>A library that has functions to communicate with a braille terminal.
Basically, a driver has functions to open communication with the
braille terminal, close the communication, write on the braille
display, and read keypresses from the braille keyboard, plus some special
functions that will be described in detail in this manual.</P>

<DT><B>Key</B><DD>
<P>A code that is returned by the driver when a key is pressed. This is
different from a command, because the command concept is driver-independent
(all drivers use the same command codes - those defined by <EM>brltty</EM>), whereas
codes used for returning keypresses may vary between drivers.</P>

<DT><B>BrlAPI's Library</B><DD>
<P>This library helps clients to connect and use <EM>BrlAPI</EM>'s
server thanks to a series of <CODE>brlapi_</CODE>-prefixed functions.</P>

<DT><B>Packet</B><DD>
<P>A sequence of bytes making up the atomic unit in communications, either between
braille drivers and braille terminals or between the server and clients.</P>

<DT><B>Raw mode</B><DD>
<P>Mode in which the client application exchanges packets with the driver.
Normal operations like sending text for display or reading keypresses are
not available in this mode. It lets applications take advantage of advanced
functionalities of the driver's communication protocol.</P>

<DT><B>Server</B><DD>
<P>The part of <EM>brltty</EM> that controls incoming connections and communication
between clients and braille drivers.</P>

<DT><B>Suspend mode</B><DD>
<P>Mode in which the server keeps the device driver closed, so that the client
can connect directly to the device.</P>

<DT><B>Tty</B><DD>
<P>Synonym for console, terminal, ...  Linux' console consist of several Virtual
Ttys (VTs).  The screen program's windows also are Ttys.  X-window system's
xterms emulate Ttys as well.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc1.2">How to read this manual</A>
</H2>

<P>This manual is split in five parts.</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>
<A HREF="BrlAPI-2.html#sec-general">General description</A></B><DD>
<P>Describes more precisely what <EM>BrlAPI</EM>
is and how it works in collaboration with <EM>brltty</EM>'s core, the braille driver
and clients. In this part, a "connection-use-disconnection" scenario
will be described step by step, explaining for each step what <EM>BrlAPI</EM> does in
reaction to client instructions. These explanations will take place at a
user level.</P>

<DT><B>
<A HREF="BrlAPI-3.html#sec-concurrency">Concurrency management</A></B><DD>
<P>This part explains how concurrency between <EM>BrlAPI</EM> clients is handled
thanks to focus tellers.</P>

<DT><B>
<A HREF="BrlAPI-4.html#sec-install">Installation and configuration</A></B><DD>
<P>This part explains in detail how to install and configure the API. For
instructions on how to install and configure <EM>brltty</EM>, please report to
the <EM>brltty</EM> documentation.</P>

<DT><B>
<A HREF="BrlAPI-5.html#sec-library">Library description</A></B><DD>
<P>This part describes how client applications
can communicate with the server using the <EM>BrlAPI</EM> library that
comes with <EM>brltty</EM>. Each function will be briefly described,
classified by categories. More exhaustive descriptions of every
function are available in the corresponding online manual pages.</P>

<DT><B>
<A HREF="BrlAPI-6.html#sec-drivers">Writing braille drivers</A></B><DD>
<P>This part describes how the braille drivers included in <EM>brltty</EM> should be
written in order to take advantage of <EM>BrlAPI</EM>'s services.</P>

<DT><B>
<A HREF="BrlAPI-7.html#sec-protocol">Protocol reference</A></B><DD>
<P>This part describes in detail the communication
protocol that is used to communicate between server and clients.</P>

</DL>
</P>
<P>What should be read probably depends on what should be done by applications with
<EM>BrlAPI</EM>.</P>
<P>Reading chapters 
<A HREF="BrlAPI-2.html#sec-general">General description</A>, 
<A HREF="BrlAPI-3.html#sec-concurrency">Concurrency management</A> and 
<A HREF="BrlAPI-4.html#sec-install">Installation and configuration</A> is recommended, since they provide
useful information and (hopefully) lead to a good understanding of <EM>BrlAPI</EM>,
for an efficient use.</P>
<P>Chapter 
<A HREF="BrlAPI-5.html#sec-library">Library description</A> concerns writing
applications that take advantage of braille terminals so as to bring specific
(and more useful) information to blind people.</P>
<P>Chapter 
<A HREF="BrlAPI-6.html#sec-drivers">Drivers</A> is for braille driver implementation: either adding a braille driver
to <EM>brltty</EM> or modifying an existing one so that it can benefit from
<EM>BrlAPI</EM>'s features, this chapter will be of interest, since it describes
exactly what is needed to write a driver for <EM>brltty</EM>: the core
of drivers interface for instance.</P>
<P>Finally, chapter 
<A HREF="BrlAPI-7.html#sec-protocol">Protocol reference</A> is for <EM>not using</EM> the library, but using the <EM>BrlAPI</EM>
server directly, when the library might not be sufficient: it describes the
underlying protocol that will have to be used to do so.</P>
