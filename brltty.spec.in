Summary: Braille display driver for Linux/Unix.
%description
BRLTTY is a background process (daemon) which provides access to
the console screen (when in text mode) for a blind person using a
refreshable braille display.  It drives the braille display, and
provides complete screen review functionality.  Some speech capability
has also been incorporated.

Install this package if you use a refreshable braille display.
