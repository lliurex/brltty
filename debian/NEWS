brltty (5.4-1~1) experimental; urgency=medium

    Authenticating BrlAPI clients now defaults to using policykit too.
    It means that logged-in users can now run orca and similar programs
    using brlapi without having to be able to read /etc/brlapi.key,
    which is thus not world-readable by default any more.

brltty (5.4-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  If you do not use a Braille display connected via USB, you now need to
  enable BrlTTY by enabling the BrlTTY systemd service: sudo systemctl enable
  brltty

brltty (3.7.2-7ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * In order for brltty to run from the init script, you must now set
    RUN_BRLTTY=yes in /etc/default/brltty. (This is not required for
    non-serial USB devices, for which brltty is started automatically by
    udev.)

brltty (3.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Prior to this version, braille driver/device
    selection was done via a configuration dialog (debconf).
    Support for this method of configuring /etc/brltty.conf was
    dropped in this version since the configuration file format
    changed significantly.
    The new default configuration supports all
    USB capable displays out of the box.  If you are using
    a display which is connected to your computer by USB,
    you will not need to tweak the configuration.
    Otherwise, please edit /etc/brltty.conf accordingly after
    upgrading this package, and manually restart brltty
    to make the new version active.
