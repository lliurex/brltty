  * Alva/Optelec (ABT3xx, Delphi, Satellite, Braille System 40, BC 640/680)
  * Baum
  * BrailComm
  * BrailleLite
  * BrailleNote
  * Cebra
  * EcoBraille
  * EuroBraille (AzerBraille, Clio, Esys, Iris, NoteBraille, Scriba)
  * Freedom Scientific (Focus and PacMate)
  * Handy Tech
  * HIMS (Braille Sense, SyncBraille)
  * HumanWare (Brailliant)
  * Iris
  * LogText 32
  * MDV
  * Metec (BD-40)
  * NinePoint
  * Papenmeier

 BRLTTY also provides a client/server based infrastructure for applications
 wishing to utilize a Braille display.  The daemon process listens for incoming
 TCP/IP connections on a certain port.  A shared object library for clients is
 provided in the package libbrlapi0.8.  A static library, header files and
 documentation is provided in package libbrlapi-dev.  Bindings to other
 programming languages can be found in cl-brlapi (Lisp), libbrlapi-java (Java)
 and python3-brlapi (Python).
