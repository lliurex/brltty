# BRLTTY is a background process (daemon) providing access to the Linux/Unix
# console (when in text mode) for a blind person using a refreshable braille
# display.

# This is a simple Upstart job. Copy it into your distribution's Upstart
# jobs directory and modify as appropriate for your needs. Possible
# locations for this directory include:
# * /etc/init/jobs.d/
# * /etc/event.d/
# * /etc/init/
# Set its permissions, ownership, and name as per the other Upstart jobs.

console output
respawn

# This service is started automatically by init so that braille output is
# available as soon as possible on system startup.

exec /bin/brltty -n
