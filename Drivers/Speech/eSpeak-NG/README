This directory contains the BRLTTY speech driver for the eSpeak-NG text to
speech engine.  The eSpeak-NG web site is
https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/.

eSpeak-NG comes with a simple command-line tool called espeak-ng which can be
used to test it, and to recompile modified dictionaries, etc. Please see
the espeak-ng man page for more information.

BRLTTY's configure script automatically includes this driver if the
eSpeak-NG development library is installed.

This driver recognizes the following parameters:

path

	Specifies the directory containing the espeak-ng-data directory.
	If not specified, the default location is used.
	
punctlist

	Specified a list of punctuation characters whose names are to be
	spoken when the speech punctuation parameter is set to "Some".
	If not specified, a default list is used.

voice

	Specifies a voice/language to use.  The complete list of available
	voices may be obtained with the command 'espeak-ng --voices'.

maxrate

	Overrides the maximum speech rate value. The default is 450.
	This cannot be lower than 80.
